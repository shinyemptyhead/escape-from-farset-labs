Escape From Farset Labs is a light-hearted short interactive fiction game created as an example for the [Northern Ireland Developers Conference 2024](https://www.nidevconf.com). If you've never played a game like this before, the idea is that you type in commands to carry out actions. The aim is to figure out how to repair your bike so you can leave the labs and go home.

This game is set at Farset Labs. Farset Labs are a Belfast-based open community of students, professionals, academics, freelancers, artists, hackers, and organizers that believe strongly in experimental learning and the Do-It-Yourself ethic. We facilitate technology initiatives and encourage hands-on learning by maintaining a workshop and creative space that is available to members. We maintain an inclusive membership policy, and strive to apply the principles of the open-software and open-hardware movements within our design policies. The name 'Farset' comes from the ancient river that Belfast is built on. To learn more visit [our website](https://www.farsetlabs.org.uk).
